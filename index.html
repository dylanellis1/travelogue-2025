      <p>Three places I love and why you might like them too.</p>

        <p>The reason I love this spot is not only because of the view, but also the adventure it takes to get there. Located near the downtown of Calgary by Rotary park, this spot is best viewed at night. TO get there you first must trek your way through the woods until you find a fence, at that fence you must take a left into the grass until you find a rope. Once you find the rope climb up the wall using the rope and from there you will be able to chill and have a great voiew of the city.</p>

    <h2>Location 2: Canmore Grassi Lakes</h2>

    <p>This spot is particularily nice because of how colourful the lakes are and the caves that are located right beside them. To get this location it's an easy hour hike up past some falls and wildlife. Once you reach the top you can sit and enjoy the views of the town, the beautiful lakes, caves, or if you so choose you can continue hiking up to Ha Ling for a view of all the mountains. This spot also has some emotional connection for me because I went here a lot when I was first moving to Canmore.</p>

  <section id="location3">
    <h2>Location 3: Banff Bridge</h2>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>This is the spot I would go to whenever I had a break from work. The reason Id reccomend it is just the spectacular view of the mountain range and there are less tourists here. Its a nice place to have lunch and just breathe in the mountain air. If you come to this spot I would suggest taking a walk down over to the golf course too because it is fairly close and also provides some good viewpoints. </p>
